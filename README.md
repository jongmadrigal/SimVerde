***SimBasin - Participatory decision support system for the Verde River Basin in Mexico in the context of the Zapotillo conflict***

Authors: Jonatan Godinez Madrigal, Joanne Craven and Pamela Claure Gutierrez. The user interface is based on SimBasin, available at: http://joannecraven.co.uk/projects/simbasin/. The water resources model is based on the model developed by UNOPS (2017) ‘14. Análisis de Escenarios de Modelación’, in. UNOPS. Available at: http://201.131.6.193:8001/JaliscoSostenible/informe/.

***General introduction***

The following files and folders contain the decision support system (DSS) SimVerde and the results of the most important infrastructure configuration of the Zapotillo project and water supply alternatives. This is a coupled decision support system whereby code written in Visual Basic in Excel communicates with a water resources model of the Verde River basin of Mexico, based on a a model developed by UNOPS in 2017. 

***Purpose of the dataset***

It is being made public both to act as supplementary data for publications and the PhD thesis of Jonatan Godinez Madrigal and to aid other researchers to replicate these data.

***Data description***

The folder "Decision support system" contains three files, the user interface, the WEAP model and the compressed images folder. In order to use the DSS, one must first add the WEAP model to the WEAP software and open it. Second, the user must open the excel file and follow the instructions therein described.

The folder "Model results" contains the results of 110 scenarios of different Zapotillo project configurations and alternative solutions.
