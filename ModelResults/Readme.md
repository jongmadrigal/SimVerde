***Data Description***
This folder is intended to share the raw data of the scenarios described in the paper "The limits to large scale supply augmentation: Exploring the crossroads of conflicting urban water system development pathways".
The compiled data is laid out as follows: 5 Excel files that contain the four most important groups of infrastructure configurations of the Zapotillo project and alternative solutions. 
1. RawDataDamDecommission.xlsx contains the 15 scenarios we run without considering the Zapotillo project, only the alternatives. 
2. RawData60malt.xlsx contains 30 scenarios with infrastructure configurations with a Zapotillo dam with a height of 60 m.
3. RawData80malt.xlsx contains 30 scenarios with infrastructure configurations with a Zapotillo dam with a height of 80 m.
4. RawData105malt.xlsx contains 30 scenarios with infrastructure configurations with a Zapotillo dam with a height of 105 m.
5. RawDataZapotillo.xlsx contains 3 scenarios with the three different Zapotillo dam configurations without any alternative.

Each file contains the description of each scenario and its results in terms of Coverage (%), Environmental flows deficit (m3/s), and Change in Groundwater storage (m3/s)

*It is worth noting that these results may slighthly varied if replicated on WEAP, since newer versions might tweak the built-in calculations solver.
